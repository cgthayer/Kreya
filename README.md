# Kreya

Kreya is a gRPC GUI client. It makes calling gRPC APIs easy! Supported features:
- Server reflection
- Unary, client-streaming, server-streaming and duplex requests
- File based storage for easy git-syncing (or any other syncing software)
- Authentication configurations - declare once, use everywhere
- Environments
- Powerful templating language
- Project or directory settings (ex. define the gRPC endpoint only once for all requests)
- And more!
